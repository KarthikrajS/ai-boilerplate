# AI Boilerplate

This repository provides a modular foundation for integrating and using AI models in your applications. You can easily plug in different AI models, switch between them, and interact with them via standardized API routes.

## Features:
- Support for multiple AI models (e.g., GPT, Create routes to interact with AI services in your RecommendationService.js and TaskOptimizationService.js).
- Configurable via environment variables.
- JWT-based authentication for secure access to AI endpoints.
- Data preprocessing and model interaction are abstracted into reusable services.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
```
npx degit KarthikrajS/ai-boilerplate my-ai
cd my-ai
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Set up environment variables in the `.env` file.
4. Start the server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Usage:
- Make POST requests to `/api/ai/optimizeTasks` or other available routes to interact with the models.

## Extending:
- Add new AI models by creating a new file in the `models/` directory and updating `ModelService.js`.
- Add new API routes as needed in `routes/aiRoutes.js`.
